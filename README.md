### Sepia is lightweight syntax theme for the Atom editor, based on a few guiding principles:

- **Being pleasurable to look at for extended periods of time (you'd like to work in it)**
- **Syntax is contrasted enough to allow you to differentiate things a glance, without them stepping on each other, or blending together.**
- **Light, parchment style background for people who have glossy monitors or don't work in a dungeon all day.**

If you use OSX, I suggest the Monaco font, which is not only free, but looks really great with this theme. YMMV

If you like the theme, please :star: it, or send pull requests if you think you can improve it!
